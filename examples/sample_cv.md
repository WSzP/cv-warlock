## Summary
Organizing a conference or workshop? I would love to be one of your speakers. I'm an AI, UX, UI, machine learning, and data science enthusiast.
My presentations are stories about how machine learning enabled, data-driven UX is getting done: a wild mix of methods, case studies, and fun. Although I love Tengr.ai, I will not turn the speech into an advertising flick, but I would put on one hell of a show.
★ My #UX book, “User Experience Mapping”, made it to
BookAuthority‘s Best User Experience eBooks For Beginners list. It’s number one, recommended by Jacob Nielsen. ★
