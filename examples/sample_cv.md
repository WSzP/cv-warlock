## Summary

Hands-on AI and product leader with 21 years across UX, engineering, and machine learning, known for shipping end-to-end outcomes while staying close to the code (I still code daily). Over the last 2 years, I’ve built production Agentic AI using LangChain, then LangGraph and LangSmith, delivering autonomous agents, agentic swarms, and orchestrators that drive measurable business impact through reliable tool use, observability, and iteration loops.
Previously, as Founder and CEO of Tengr.ai, I led end-to-end delivery of a generative image AI product from research roadmap to iterative releases, including HPC-based experimentation and privacy-by-design and safety systems. Earlier, I scaled AceTech Development from 0 to 40+ people in under two years and completed a successful exit. I’m also the author of User Experience Mapping and a long-time TEDx curator, bringing strong storytelling and stakeholder alignment to every build.

## Experience

### Head of Artificial Intelligence at Magic Solutions

September 2025 - Present | Târgu Mureș, Romania

- Led organisation-wide AI readiness transformation using the KUA method
(Kaizen, UX, AI - with QA focus) by defining an actionable operating model (people, process, tooling), aligning adoption with business goals and delivery constraints, and translating strategy into measurable execution.
- Built internal capability and accelerated upskilling by mentoring colleagues,
introducing new technologies, and establishing practical learning routines that increased delivery confidence and reduced reliance on single experts.
- Strengthened delivery governance through repeatable processes by
designing, documenting, and transferring workflows, standards, and escalation paths, supporting consistent execution and audit-friendly traceability across projects.
- Provided technical and architectural leadership for new initiatives by shaping
project architecture, selecting tooling, and supporting implementation decisions to reduce delivery risk and improve maintainability.
- Enabled cross-functional execution via hands-on problem resolution by
unblocking teams through structured technical support and escalation handling, ensuring continuity and predictable progress under real delivery pressure.

### Conference Curator - TEDxTârguMureș at TED Conferences

March 2017 - Present | Târgu Mureș, Romania

Curator and lead organiser of TEDxTarguMures since 2017, responsible for end-to-end event delivery (theme curation, speaker selection and coaching, partner management, logistics, production planning, and quality control). Strong public communication and storytelling skills, with a proven ability to translate complex ideas into accessible narratives for broad audiences. Experienced in community building and stakeholder engagement, growing long-term partnerships and volunteer teams.

### Founder, CEO at Tengrai Artificial Intelligence

October 2022 - August 2025 | Târgu Mureș, Romania

- Led end-to-end delivery of a generative image AI product in Europe from
research roadmap through implementation and iterative releases, coordinating technical workstreams, priorities, and delivery cycles in a high-accountability environment with operational, monitoring, and execution focus. We released many unique features before competing solutions, such as transparent background generation and very high resolution upscaling.
- Executed continuous model refinement on HPC infrastructure (NCC Hungary
- Komondor HPC), planning compute-intensive experimentation cycles,
tracking outcomes across versions, and converting results into actionable release decisions. Leveraged the AI partition of 32 Nvidia A100 GPUs across 4 HPE Apollo Blades to rapidly iterate generative AI art models for photorealistic rendering, illustration, and more.
- This HPC success story was featured in EuroCC 2/EuroCC4SEE Success
Stories 2nd Edition, September 2024 (p20-21)
- Designed and implemented a privacy-by-design architecture for generative
AI, embedding data protection and governance into system design and operational workflows, reflecting the kind of structured, control-oriented approach. Created the model card in alignment with the EU AI Act, way before being required by the law.
- Created and operationalised the Hyperalign safety system to ensure high-
quality generation with robust safeguards, translating risk thinking into repeatable procedures, review steps, and quality controls.
- Established documentation and standardisation practices (templates, release
notes, internal guidelines, decision logs) to keep work reproducible and transparent across iterations
- Produced structured reporting for stakeholders by summarising model
progress, safety posture, and delivery status into clear written materials and presentation-ready outputs.

### Founder and Executive Director at AceTech Development

October 2018 - October 2022 | Târgu Mureș, Romania

- Scaled a high-performing and innovative technology organisation from 0 to
40+ employees in under two years, demonstrating structured growth planning, prioritisation, and operational discipline consistent with the company's need for reliable coordination across multiple stakeholders and workstreams.
- Built a sustainable talent acquisition and onboarding system with zero
advertising spend and no recruitment agencies, creating repeatable processes and clear role expectations
- Achieved exceptional retention and employee satisfaction by establishing
a strong organisational culture, transparent communication routines, and practical people management, reflecting the collaboration, service orientation, and team effectiveness required in an international public-sector environment.
- Implemented delivery and quality governance early (cadences,
responsibilities, escalation paths, and documentation standards), improving predictability and accountability
- Executed a successful exit with positive outcomes for all parties,
demonstrating integrity, negotiation capability, and risk-aware decision-making

### Blockchain UX Consultant at CasinoCoin

September 2017 - October 2018 | Isle of Man

### Senior Manager UX/UI at Flutter Entertainment

September 2015 - May 2017 | London, United Kingdom

- Contributed to an award-winning free-to-play title (Duel, recognised in 2016)
by supporting UX/UI execution quality, iteration speed, and player-focused design decisions under tight delivery cycles.
- Drove measurable UX and conversion improvements across key landing
pages by establishing a structured optimisation practice (hypothesis- driven testing, analytics-based decision making, and release discipline), strengthening operational rigor and performance monitoring.
- Improved core game user experience and usability through close
collaboration with product, engineering, and game teams, translating complex requirements into clear interaction patterns and production-ready UI specifications.
- Built and led the first group-level UX/UI function (transitioning from ad-hoc,
project-based design support to an organised capability), defining standards, workflows, and governance that improved consistency, efficiency, and stakeholder alignment.
- Owned significant front-end responsibilities alongside UX leadership,
ensuring designs were feasible, scalable, and implemented with high fidelity, and creating tighter feedback loops between design intent and delivered product.
- Strengthened cross-team communication and stakeholder management by
producing concise, decision-oriented documentation and aligning multiple teams around shared priorities, timelines, and definitions of “done”.
- Initiated early experimentation with AI-enabled approaches to augment
UX workflows and exploration, showing practical curiosity and an applied innovation mindset

### User Experience Director at whatusersdo.com

August 2014 - September 2015 | London, United Kingdom
