## Summary

Hands-on AI & product leader with 21 years across UX, engineering, and machine learning. Still coding daily and shipping end-to-end outcomes.

Over the last 2 years, I’ve built production agentic AI (LangChain → LangGraph/LangSmith), delivering autonomous agents, swarms, and orchestrators with reliable tool use, observability, and tight iteration loops that drive measurable business impact.

As Founder of Tengr.ai, I led a generative image AI product from research roadmap to iterative releases, including HPC experimentation plus privacy-by-design and safety systems.

I scaled AceTech Development from 0 to 40+ people in under two years and completed a successful exit.

I’m also the author of User Experience Mapping and a long-time TEDx curator, bringing sharp storytelling and stakeholder alignment to every build.
